  Onyxalis
</h1>
<br>
<h2 style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Onyxalis is a 2d procedurally generated open-world rouge-like with survival, horror, and sandbox elements. <br> 
  It is inspired by games like Don't Starve, Terraria, SCP SL, and some of my previous projects. <br>
  It is intended to host games of large player counts (30+ players), and potentially includes proximity chat, matchmaking, and LAN servers.<br>

<h3>
  The Way Of The Game:<br>
</h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
       <li>1 of all the players that spawn in will spawn in with the Onyxalis.</li><br>
       <li>The Onyxalis must be kept safe.</li><br>
       <li>Death is permanent.</li><br>
       <li>Players that die become wraiths. Their job is to protect living players.</li><br>
       <li>If the Player that holds the Onyxalis dies, the Onyxalis is destroyed.</li><br>
       <li>If the Onyxalis gets destroyed, all of the surviving players enter Hardcore Mode (Increases the difficulty and sets a timer for all living players)</li> <br>
       <li>Wraiths can attack living players in Hardcore Mode. </li><br>
       <li>Once the Onyxalis is destroyed, it drops shards that may be picked up by surviving players and repaired given enough time, and normal gameplay will resume.</li><br>
       <li>The game ends when every player is dead. </li><br>
</ul>
